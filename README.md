# MRCSNet
Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Compressive Sensing of Magnetic Resonance Images （CS-MRI）

## Notice: 
 - The training code will be published after the paper is accepted.
 - The models (CSNet96_10.pt and CSNet96_30.pt) are trained at the sampling ratios 10% and 30% using an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. 

## Requirements
 - Python 3.5.x
 - Pytorch 0.4.1
